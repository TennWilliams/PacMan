This is a PacMan game that uses functions and arrays to create and display multiply pacman in the box once the add pacman button is clicked.  Then you will click start game to see the pacman move across the scren at different speeds and directions.  Once the hit the predefined box border they will reverse directions.  This is done by changing the images of the pacman to ones that are facing a different direction.

## Future improvments 
I would to change the size of the pacman when they hit the border.
